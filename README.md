# MESH: Minnesota Engine for Scalable Evolving Hypergraph Analysis

MESH is an open-source framework of algorithms and system components to support scalable analysis of evolving hypergraph structures. 


### Goals

* Support a rich API for ease of expressing hypergraph algorithms

* Provide scalability across machines and to large datasets

* Provide flexibility to support different datasets and algorithms

* Characterize and optimize for real-world hypergraphs

* Design new algorithms to capture real-world group phenomena

In order to run MESH, you need to apply Graphx Patch for MESH. Patch file can be accessed from [here](Graphx-Patch/meshGraphx_branch-1.6).

## Building MESH
*Note we are currently supporting MESH only for Graphx 1.6. So, in order to work with MESH, download graphx from spark branch-1.6.*

Prerequisites for building MESH:

* Unix-like environment ( We like and use Ubuntu )
* git
* Maven (we recommend version 3.3.9)
* Java 7 or 8
* Scala version 2.10.5


Patch for Graphx - Before using MESH, apply patch on Graphx and build the graphx library. Patch file can be accessed from [here](Graphx-Patch/meshGraphx_branch-1.6.patch).

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/spark.git
cd spark
git checkout branch-1.6
git apply meshGraphx_branch-1.6.patch
```
To build graphx jar, follow the documentation from Spark source, which can be accessed from [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.0/building-spark.html). 

Next, add graphx jar into local maven repository. To do that, run:
```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=spark-graphx-mesh -DartifactId=spark-graphx-mesh -Dversion=1.6.0 -Dpackaging=jar
```
**Where:**

* path-to-file: Path to the graphx-JAR to install

MESH is built using Apache Maven. To built MESH and its examples, run:
```
mvn -DskipTests clean package
```

## How to Run

You can find details of how to execute your graph data using MESH such as input data format and execution command at [here](http://mesh.cs.umn.edu/setup.html), and a programming guide (MESH APIs) at [here](http://mesh.cs.umn.edu/guide.html).
